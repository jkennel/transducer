This package simplifies reading transducer (pressure and temperature) files from a number of common sources.  Particular care has been taken to ensure that functions are relatively fast.  If you would like a new transducer dataset to be included, or find any errors please let me know.  This package is a work in progress and the output format is likely to change. 


## Installation
